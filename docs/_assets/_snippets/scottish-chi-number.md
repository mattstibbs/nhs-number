!!! note "Scottish CHI Number validation"
    At present, this library does not reliably validate Scottish CHI Numbers. This is because the first 6 digits of a Scottish CHI Number must be a valid DDMMYY Date of Birth, and this library does not currently check for this. At the moment, only the correct number range is checked for.

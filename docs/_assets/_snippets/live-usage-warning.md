!!! danger "IMPORTANT: **You should never need to generate an NHS Number for a live system**"
    Live NHS, CHI, H&C and IHI numbers are _always_ generated by some kind of central authority or registry, such as the NHS Spine in England, and they are assigned to patients, often at or near birth or at the point of becoming a user of that health system.

    Unless you represent a central health authority, you should not need to generate an NHS Number for a live system. If you are a patient, you should never need to generate an NHS Number for yourself.

    This package is intended for use in testing and development environments where you need to generate NHS Numbers for testing, research purposes, or synthetic data generation.

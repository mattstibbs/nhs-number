The main documentation site is at <https://uk-fci.github.io/nhs-number/>. Pushes of code to the `main` branch will automatically trigger a publication to Netlify.

Non-`main` branches of the documentation are no longer automatically published for review purposes:

## Material for MkDocs

We use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) along with the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

You can suggest changes directly through PRs.

When developing the documentation site, we recommend the use of a linter such as [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) for VSCode to standardise formatting.
